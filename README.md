OVERVIEW:

This program interprets a language (specifically Java) in this case
to C using a parser, scanner, and a node based interpretation.
 
TESTING:

This program I ran throught the included tester, I got the limited tests
working decently well but ran into intermediary errors once in a while
where the sytax of the clang would stop functioning and the whole tester
would bug out.
